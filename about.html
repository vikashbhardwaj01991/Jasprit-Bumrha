                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-900">Early Life and Family</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Jasprit Bumrah was born on December 6, 1993, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, to a Punjabi family. His father, Jasbir Singh Bumrah, was a businessman who passed away when Jasprit was just two years old due to illness. This left his mother, Daljit Bumrah, to raise him and his brother Jaskaran single-handedly. Daljit worked multiple jobs, including as a school teacher and in a handicraft shop, to provide for the family. Bumrah often credits his mother's resilience as the biggest influence in his life.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Growing up in the Satellite area of Ahmedabad, Bumrah's childhood was modest. He attended JK Shah Classes for education but was more passionate about sports. Cricket wasn't his first love; he initially played badminton and table tennis at a state level. It was during his school days at Acharya Modi School that he picked up cricket seriously, inspired by watching fast bowlers like Wasim Akram and Brett Lee on TV.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Bumrah's early cricket was self-taught. He honed his skills on local maidans (grounds) with makeshift stumps. His unorthodox action stemmed from a back injury in his teens, which prevented him from bowling overarm conventionally. Instead of quitting, he adapted, developing a slinging technique that became his signature.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-blue-900">Personal Life</h3>
                <p class="text-lg mb-3">Bumrah married Sanjana Ganesan, a sports anchor and model, in a low-key ceremony on March 15, 2021, in Goa. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Jaisal, in September 2020 (born prematurely but healthy). Bumrah is known for his private nature, rarely sharing personal details on social media. He follows a strict vegan diet for fitness and practices yoga to manage stress.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">Off the field, Bumrah is involved in philanthropy through his mother's foundation, supporting underprivileged children in Gujarat. He also endorses brands like ASICS, boAt, and Dream11, using his platform to promote fitness and mental health awareness among youth.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-center text-blue-900">Inspirations and Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-center mb-4">Bumrah's mantra is "Stay Hungry, Stay Humble." He draws inspiration from his mother and legends like Kapil Dev. In interviews, he emphasizes hard work over talent: "Cricket taught me discipline. Every yorker is a result of hours in the nets." His journey from street cricket to Lord's is a testament to perseverance.</p>
